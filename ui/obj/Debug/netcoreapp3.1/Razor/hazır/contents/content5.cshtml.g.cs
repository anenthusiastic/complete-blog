<p>Whether we interact online in the protected spaces of Facebook, or out in the great wide open on Twitter, we all collect a diverse following of friends, family and acquaintances. My personal friends list includes colleagues across my areas of research in anthropology, public health, and medical education (people I know in real life), acquaintances from school days, relatives, and other moms of children with special healthcare needs (people I may not know in real life). My friends and followers are mostly scientists or “science-adjacent” (such as folks who&nbsp;&nbsp;engage daily with medical interventions but otherwise don’t interact with research). And some are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/politics/anthony-fauci-coronavirus-anti-science-bias/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">anti-scientists</a>.</p>
